# E2B sandbox template config for this repo.
# Build this template with your E2B API key for YOUR team to avoid 403 errors.
# Tip:
# - Do NOT set template_id here when building a brand new template; the CLI will create one for your team.
# - Optionally set a unique template_name to find it easily in the dashboard.
# - Use the E2B API key that belongs to the same team you want to use.

# After building, copy the resulting Template ID into your .env as E2B_TEMPLATE_ID
# and restart your Next.js + Inngest Dev Server.

# If you want to hard-bind to a specific team, you can set team_id below, but it's
# recommended to omit it and let the CLI use the team of your API key.
# team_id = "4cbf2aa9-99af-46e6-bdfd-c03d02e3daff"
